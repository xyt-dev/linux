American Linux kernel
============

Code is cheap, show me your nationality!

When Linus arrived at the open-source community, all the coders looked at him and laughed. Some called out, "Linus, you've got another scar on your face!" He did not respond but said to the person behind the counter, "Write two lines of code, block all Russian maintainers." Then he revealed his identity as the founder of the Linux community. They deliberately shouted louder, "You must have stolen something again!"
Linus opened his eyes wide and said, "How can you slander me like this without any evidence..."
"What evidence? I saw with my own eyes that you stole Russian code the day before yesterday, and they hung you up and hit you."
Linus's face turned red, and the veins on his forehead stood out as he argued, "Stealing code doesn't count as theft... stealing code! ... Can it be considered theft for a programmer?" Then he went on to say some incomprehensible things about "American sanctions" and "Russian aggression," which made everyone burst into laughter; the air inside and outside the place was filled with joy.
